WE ARE DECLARING RECURSIVE DATA STRUCTURES FOR ENCODING COOL AST

When declaring types, the * creates a tuple
| indicates different forms for variant types.
ie a feature can be a Method or an Attribute

The and keyword allows you to reference other types in a type definitoin
  ie using other types to define a type

Declaring types allows us to define the valid types that methods can return
ie a method will return a feature, which can either be a Method or Attribute.

They are also self documenting.
